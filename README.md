# Guess My Number

This is my first project.
OnDocumentload a random number between 0 and 20 is generated.
The user has an input field to guess that number.
When the user clicks on the check button, the HTML next to the inputfield will show the user whether his guess was correct, too high or too low.
If his guess was correct, the body background color will change to green and the correct number will be displayed in a big font on the page.
The user has 20 tries, displayed by a score on the righthand side of the webpage, each time the user submits a false try (clicks check) his score goes down.
When the Score reaches 0 the game is over, the background turns red, and a game over html is generated.
The best score the user achieves will be stored in a highscore underneath the score, so when the user clicks on the again button, the whole game resets, but his previous highscore remains, waiting to be beaten.

I use the "Diagram Software and Flowchart Maker" to devise a flowchart on the step by step implementation of the program.
